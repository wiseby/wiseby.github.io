### Time For Production

The team want's to deploy the application as soon as possible. When we hit the launch date there should be a minimum amount of features supported.

We had a meeting with a lot of people who used the old application on a regular basis. Feedback was great and only minor changes where introduced.

Finished the last api integrations in the client-app (where it comes to the GET functions), all data that needs exposure is present in the app.

Next week we will be focusing on the update features that actually is going to make this app do what it's supposed to. All edit/update modals should have persistent action as result to save/add/delete.

I also need to think more of my examination project. I have decided that I'm going to build a home-automation server software focusing on modular DIY IoT devices. OpenSource of course and strongly tied to technologies that I'm familiar with.The idea is really to make it easy and fun to make a custom home-automation out of things like, Arduinos, Raspberry Pis, etc. I think that the biggest issue for those who tinkers with these kind of things is the lack of knowledge about server-side programming and how to make all things work together. With this project there is going to be well documented step by step instructions on how to integrate devices to the system. Also some basic schematics on devices that fit the system with ease like temperature sensors, camera surveillance, light control, to name a few.
What I'm after is that feeling of satisfaction on doing something on your own. It's no Iron Man suite but close enough!

I'm going to try out a new CSS framework, [bulma](https://bulma.io/) seems to be a nice one. It's always good to have an alternative to bootstrap.

Frontend style/UX is not my sharpest tools in my drawer, a framework makes my life easier to get things done. Focusing on the stuff I'm good at and doing the things I love.
I'm trying to remove all parts that make's me lose momentum.

**Until next week. Take care now! bye bye then!**

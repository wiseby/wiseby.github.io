  New week new challanges! I feel great! The sunday depression feeling is no
  longer of existens in my life. The turn-around happened when I finally found
  that place in my life where everything clicked. I'm partially talking about
  changing my carreer from industrial worker to become a programmer. Never
  turning back!

  Monday was in and out in different meetings. Many questions needed answers
  before we could go forward with our project. The first meeting was a
  walkthrough of how the anatomy of the WebApi should be built. A fairly new
  developer at Centiro (had been working as a fullstack developer at a smaller
  company before) introduced us to mediator-pattern, dapper, vertical-slicing
  and a number of enterprice specific libraries used by other similar projects.
  It wasn't that hard understanding all the pieces and the architecture was
  straight forward at most part. The second meeting was with the main team for
  the application. Here we have a application-specialist and a UX designer and
  together we got into details about the views and features necessary for the
  administration application. Databases and tables where introduced to build the
  models used throughout the process of administration of sender-data.

  Tuesday was all about getting a list to become a object with children through
  parent - child relationships. We tested a bunch of methods without solving the
  problem. We got stuck in code so we decided to make another approach,
  FlowDiagram and Pseudo-code. I cut out items to represent objects on
  flashcards, these represented objects in a list. This method helped me
  visualize the problem and to determine what kind of pattern was hidden. The
  only properties that we had to go on was if an object had children or not. In
  this case we didn't even know wich was the root object because the data was a
  part of a bigger domain shopped of to hide domain not relevent to a perticular
  customer. It means that the root object also had a reference to another object
  not accessable in our collection. Somewhere in the back of my head I had the
  solution wich involved a recursive methodcall, I'm most possitive that it will
  come to me later but the important thing is to get a solution now so we could
  go forward, we could always come back to this code later and refactorize.

  We ended up the day by breaking down bigger work items into smaller tasks in
  Azure DevOps and tried to create a new sprint to get all stories into place in
  the sprint. But unfortunatly we had no permissions to add this at the time.
  This would get fixed later in the week.

        Wednesday and we nailed it! After tuesday punching a brickwall we drew a
        map! Not literaly a map but a flowchart. It took 30min or so and when we
        where happy with it just a few minutes later, the code was written,
        pressed save and loaded the application. Guess what happend? It worked
        on the first try! Dont underestimate the power of planning and using
        well known techniques. After todays work we where on our way finishing
        our table-view of data with a tree-like structure.

  This weeks feeling is exitment. Maybe some frustration on the thought were not
  writing enough code. Alot of time is spent on planning.

<p>
  The weather this week makes me think of how greatful I am having a roof over
  my head and a warm bed to sleep in. We take alot of things for granted!
</p>

<p>Until next week, give hugs from a safe distance.</p>

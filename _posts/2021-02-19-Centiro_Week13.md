## Sick Week

Our youngest daughter felt sick on monday and ended up being home for the rest of the week.
I too became sick the next day so decided to take a few days of getting better.
I was able to participate on meetings/planning almost the entire monday.
Made planning together with our mentor Eric. He had good knowledge of what needed to be done and how to prioritize.

Friday morning and I felt much better! Got some work done and made deployment on time for our weekly demo.
Thanks to Johan we completed many of the features on time! I'm very positive on how the result turned out, and how things could be checked of the list from mondays planning. There is that special feeling when you can say that a task is complete and can move it from the in-progress-column to the done-column on the planning-board.

We will have the same approach next week with clear goals on a weekly basis.

Thats a shorter friday post than normal, hopefully staying healthy onwards so I could be more productive and publish some more content to the site.

**Until next week. Take care now! bye bye then!**

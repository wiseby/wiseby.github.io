## The Pace is Quickening!

More and more personnel are forced to use the new application so our mentor and application specialist have had a though week acting as support for confused users.
Removing the old way of doing things have created a lot of frustration. This is because the users have not been informed about the new app. When they where given the new client they have quickly
settled and most of them are very happy with how it ended up.

It has been a productive week with new releases almost every day with new features added. The work has been a mix of pair-programming and stand-alone sessions solving different pieces of the puzzle.
Johan feels more comfortable in the backend and I have been working more on the frontend. It's a well oiled machinery I would say. The team works great and I couldn't be happier, this feels like a great place to work!

The focus is features rather than bug-fixes/error-handling. This has to do with how much time we have left on the project. It's important to get users feedback before polishing, I mean It's a waste of time fixing bugs on features that are not used. Used Dapper with Transactions for the create actions on the database.

Investigations on bugs that doesn't exist has consumed much time. Some people thought that the application didn't work properly, but it was a human error reading from wrong database.

Started the employment process and was asked to complete an assignment to prove my skills as a System-Developer. Took me about 10 hours to complete, hopefully it impresses someone. It should be interesting discussing
my solution on a interview later on. It feels like all the hard work finally pay's off. From the day I decided to become a professional programmer to the day I graduate (2018 - 2021) has been life-changing and I'm in a very good place right now.

# Ikigai

When I'm on the move (walking, driving, grocery shopping) alone I tend to listen to podcasts. One that I'm quit fond of is [VÃ¤g 74](https://www.agical.se/pod/). They talk about how to become a better developer in general. There was a episode around 60 when they talked about "ikigai" in there "later" part (which they almost always have as an introduction before the main topic). Very interesting topic not just for developers, It's more of a general goal to pursue happiness, finding value in life.

This is the place I'm searching for! Feeling that I'm in the Passion zone. I know that this job I practice will give me a good chance of reaching this goal.

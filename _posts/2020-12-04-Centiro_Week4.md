Productive week and not much new to report.

Managed to migrate our application to be deployed as a docker container in kubernetes. A lot to take in in that area.
Docker is amazing as far I know and my experience is a little shallow, the only thing I used it for is to run databases locally.
There will be some deeper research into that subject soon (maybe the birth if a new article in a series around docker).

Pivoting the design by removing the tree hierarchy to a flat view with a main feature to filter out items.

Handing over a preview to our application specialists to test. This will allow us to have a quick feedback loop.
I hate building the wrong product.

Turn around tuesday. Most productive tuesday ever, until now tuesdays had been the least productive day of the week.
Celebrations where in order as we did finish much of the weeks goals this early in the week.

Man It's hard to publish content on a regular basis! My weekly posts will be a lot shorter in the future so I can focus on important subjects.
If any interesting subjects ore situation occur I'll shore to let you know!

Music Artist of the week is Queen, is there anybody out there that doesn't love Queen!
Can't imagine a world without them!

Until next week, get Schwifty!!!

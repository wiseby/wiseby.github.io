Monday on-sight picking up USB-hub that Centiro offered to make the home-office more comfortable.

Investigating database relations and the way it's set up is not in best practices we have been taught.
One example is a column with a whitespace (or in some other case colon) delimited list with reference to another table! Crazy?
I asked why this was designed the way it was and got no good answer. I'm sure that in extreme circumstances this is necessary but should be avoided.

--**Update**--
Later that week I got an email about that column being moved to another table because it was to restricted in size at some situations.

As a frontend developer should there some kind of abstraction to what we question?
Do we need understanding on how the application should be used? Or is there an abstraction level to the developer to not make design decision?
My opinion is that when working at a bigger company there should be a level of abstraction that allows me to focus on problem in my area of expertise.
It's also important to ask questions that I can relate to and trust the people I work with to do there job.
If I was to work at a smaller company there comes more responsibility to make different roles more overflowing and working together to solve problems regarding a wider range of

What about the Corporate Culture? Different when working from home?
Yes. It feels much better working from home. I think that it's something with the environment at the office that gives me some weird feelings.
The important thing is to feel confident about our mission and know what to be done.

Working as a pair work's pretty good but I sometimes feel the need to break out and finish some tasks alone.
We try to start the week with a "Weekly" to plan our goals for the week.
Picking apart bigger tasks so that we can work more independent. Until now we have worked with every task together in a form of pair-programming.
I feel like I have the need of working on some tasks alone from time to time but still have colleagues/mate only a call away if I stumble in a hole.

Working with local data inside angular application was the easiest way to get going!
Figuring out models and API endpoint maps was difficult. Next weeks plan is to make our mock-api richer in data to fullfil all edge-cases for the UI.

In this project all starts with a UI. There are many ways to develope software, for example API-first, TDD, etc.
This way we design the UI first with everything that the users want to see/do without implementing any rich features. I can see the benefit in this because
we always have something to show our customers. It's actually the only thing they would see in the end after all. When we then start building on features and backend we only need to implement the things that our Client UI contains.

Working with bootstrap is at first easy, but when you have more advanced layouts it gets confusing. Sometimes it's easier to write css on your own.

This week has been a little slow. But the result in our application are showing great promises. I would like to thank my colleague Johan for getting me through the week.
He is a great asset to our team and always spreads a smile when we have our meetings.

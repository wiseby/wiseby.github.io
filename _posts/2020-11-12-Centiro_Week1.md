This post is the starting point of a series about my time as an intern at Centiro Solutions.
I'm going to post once a week typically on fridays to sum up the events of the week.

So what happened this week then?
Me and my friend Johan (we are attending the same class and also did our last internship together) arrived at Centiro monday 9th of november 08:45.
I had my key left so there was no problem getting in the building and we headed up to our usual workplace. There we meet with our mentor Erik.

Around 10 o'clock we had our schedualed daily meeting with the team. This was also a monday whitch resulted in a recap of the passed week (They called it Weekly).
After the meeting we where handed hardware and had some time to setup our environments. This step was fairly simple because we got computers from our last intern-period.

Then we where away at our second meeting. This time we discussed our new assignment. We should build a solution for Administrating some kind o sender-data for customers (also managable from within Centiro with full access). This was a fullstack mission involving everything from a user clicked event in the application UI to fetching the data directly from the database.

Tools to be used are the following:

* Dapper for database interaction
* ASP.NET Framework (notice not ASP.NET Core!)
* Angular for WebbApplication
* CI/CD with Azure DevOps
* Deploying with OctopusDeploy

This application was already built at the time and in production. The problem was that it didn't scale well and the customer using it had some feedback to improve usability.
So we needed to build it from scratch. The design and feel of the application was not yet decidied so for our first week we played around with the mockups we where given. 
All projects was setup in version control (git in DevOps) and pipelines was also created and tested.

Under these times when a pandemic is in full effect the workplace is little different from day to day. Both thursday and friday we worked from home. Centiro is a open-minded, modern workplace which makes working from a distance easy. We are using Microsoft Teams for communication.

Not much work was done the first week, but I'm very excited and a lot to proove! The tech stack is also very intresting and goes into depth with alot of technology I wanted to dig deeper in for some time. 

Untill next friday, take care now! bye bye then!

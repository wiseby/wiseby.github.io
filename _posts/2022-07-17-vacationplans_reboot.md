### First of all some news.

I'm starting a new job in mid september as a software-developer at a company named [Makimer AB](https://www.maksimer.com/). This is a smaller company in Borås (the reason I'm changing job, Centiro was a great employer in many ways), a newly started office part of a bigger franchise, the office in Borås houses around 7 employees focusing on E-Commerce. I had a lunch with the whole team a couple of weeks ago and this feels soo good, I think that I will fit perfectly.

I've started a Instagram account called [wiseby_design](https://www.instagram.com/wiseby_design/) where I will post mostly 3D-Printing related post but also topics about electronics and programming. this was a much more pleasant place then twitter so I deleted my twitter account for a couple of reasons, mainly because some idiot tried to buy it and that there are so much crap on there. Feel free to contact me there as well.

As my new years promise and 2022 goals i ramped up my 3D-Printing activities a bit. Bought a new printer from Josef Prusa, the Mini+. What a wonderful machine, and there have been a lot of prints so far. Curious about that part? Then go and check my instagram, in the time of writing there are 50 posts available that tells the story.

I've ordered a Steam Deck in april after one of my colleagues brought one to work. I got hooked instantly, finally going to have a gaming PC again and this time it's handheld! My estimated delivery date is in late september so I'm impatiently waiting like a child before christmas!

Thats it for the update of my tech-life, let's kick of todays topic!

## Reboot

Summer vacation has finally arrived and it feels great!

My main focus is to relax, read some books and spend time with the family,
but of course I can't miss out on time doing the things I love, computer stuff!

Yesterday when I was with my family for a long car trip I had the time to think and reflect on many things. one of those things was about if I should make a vacation cleanup for my private laptop. It's still going strong after almost 3 years, and I think that I can squeeze at least one more year out of it. But the question was on how I wanted to set it up this time? Today I dual boot it with one Windows 10 install and one Ubuntu install and It's time to say byebye to my Windows part of life because honestly, I never use it! This will free upp an entire disk for my linux OS, perfect!

**Things to consider:**

- What Linux Distro should I use?
- What tools do I need?
- Gui, KDE, Gnome, ???
- Should I even change my IDE?

My conclusion was this. Debian based distro with [i3 desktop environment](https://i3wm.org/). Planck EZ I3 navigation layer, here I come!

After listening to [The Developers podcast](https://www.developerspodcast.com/), Sofia and Madde in episode #42 had an interview with Victoria Wagman and how VIM changed her life. I thought that it was time to revisit the almighty VIM text-editor. So this semester I will fully commit to it and putting my beloved VS Code on the bench for now. With my lovely keyboard I can easily create a custom layer that will help me with difficult VIM related tasks I hope.

That's it for todays post, time to get cracking. My first mission is to backup everything that has value on this machine and then wiping it clean!

_I don't know how many times I've said this but, I need a split keyboard!!! Typing these posts makes my left wrist hurt like crap. Hopefully my new employer can hook me up with one of [these](https://qweebs.com/shop/keyboards/ferris-sweep/) perhaps_

On my way to work monday morning accompanied by my wife who had an appointment in the city.
Dropped of the kids and was a little late as usual, always falling behind schedule when I'm dealing with my kids (they are worth all the time in the world!)
When I turn up at work I find only Johan sitting at his desk and complete silence. 
The idea of getting on-sight today rather than working from home was to get help from my team and figure some technical issues I've had past week. 
But we had to re think some things. I was informed that our gouvernment had issued more strict restrictions regarding the pandemic situation. 
It wasn't realy an issue so me and Johan worked on sight untill lunch and headed back home to continue working from home. 
On my way home the oldest of daughter called and had a sour? throat. 
I thought that it was best to pick them all up and had them stay home for a couple of days just in case. 
Working from home with a full house was not that easy as I thought! When you are as popular as me (popular as in first "goto" family member is me!) there was alot of interuptions during working hours.

As for the assignments of the week we where going to make the application working partially to get a look and feel in production without the need of a backend. 
Dummy data should be hardcoded into our client application to support some basic features.

This weeks team experience was good and we used microsoft liveshare in VisualStudio Code. It worked really well!
We also solved the thing with DevOps boards, as I did it last week I was trying to make a new iteration,
but I should instead make a new sprint from the iteration already existing. 
This was a 2 week iteration-template setup by the team and it was great syncing our sprints with the rest of the team.

Asking our consultants of how to implement Angular Material components granted us the answer that we shouldn't use Material dependencies if we didn't have to.
They said that NgBootstrap was the way to go and the package was already included in the project template. Tried it out and it was easy getting Bootstraps Modal component working with little to no fuzz at all.

Problems this week:

* Direct Access wasn't working properly so I didn't have access to the companies domain and services wich was neccessary to run/test all applications from home. 
My college had to run it from his machine. Sent tickets to IT Crowd but apparently they are swamped! (solved it later that week by resetting network manager.)

* Internal Design Systems where failing and resulting to abnormal behaviours in the UI. Nothing we could do, an migration of the project to run in kubernetes where scheduled for next week, 
probably fixing this issue.

* Big Corperation with alot of different opinions on how things should work! It's like sharing a stake with a group of vegetarians, nobody wants to take a bite!
It's best to have the biggest user to determine final design and functionality for the application. Build something that the user values, everything else is WASTE!

Hi!

My name is Lucas and welcome to my... blog? Ok it's yet another tech blog.

This is the part where I make a small introduction of myself.

Came to this world june 1990, born, raised in sweden. I live on the country-side with my wife and 3 kids.

Besides software-development and computers i like:

* Music (mostly progressive metal) Wielding the axe occasionally.
* I like fixing things and working with my hands (Elektronics, wood-working, cars, etc).
* 3D printing is a hobby of mine and goes hand-in-hand fixing broken stuff.
* Farming for self-sustaining lifestyle (think Stardew Valley IRL).

The list goes on, but that was from the top of my head.

Hi! 

My name is Lucas and welcome to my... blog? Ok it's yet another tech blog.

This is the part where I make a small introduction of myself.

Came to this world june 1990. born, raised and still living in sweden (you got to love sweden!). I live on the country-side with my wife and 3 kids.

Besides software-development and computers i like:

* Music (mostly progressive metal) Wielding the axe occasionally.
* I like fixing things and working with my hands.
* 3D printing is a hobby of mine and goes hand-in-hand fixing broken stuff.
* Helping people. Nothing beats the feeling when you helped someone and get that smile of gratitude from someone in need.

The list goes on, but that was from the top of my head.

For the moment I'm in my journey to become a software-developer and studying at Bor√•s Univesity? (An education with close ties to the companies demand).

**My Skillset**
* .Net Core
* Python
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Angular
* Database (MS SQL Server, MySQL)
* Basic Azure DevOps workflows
* Linux User (Terminals FTW!)

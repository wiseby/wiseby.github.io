      My story begins with a collegue who tells me to purchase a micro-controller (In this case the popular Arduino was purchased). 
      He told me that this was something that I would love to tinker with.
      He explained what possibilities it would unlock and I was amazed!
      All my life I have used computers and thought that I never could understand how it worked!
      Now I was hooking up LEDs, LCDs, resistors, buttons, servos, sensors and wrote software to make spectacular creations.

      Okej, so this wasn't that hard! I bet that I could understand how to make computer programs.
      Python was my first language for desktop(cli) programming and this was a much higher level of programming.
      I used python to create websites with flask, used pygame to develope my first game and much more.
      I did this on my spare time and worked in industrial manufacturing (wich I had done for almost 10 years at this point).

      This was the turning point in my carrier. I desided that I wanted to become a software-developer! 
      But I needed something more robust in my backpack, something to make the employers raise there eyebrows.
      An education! I began to study at Borås Yrkeshögskola were they started a new 2 year program with the title "System Developer .NET".
      This was a perfect oppertunity and I was already familiar with C#, this would give something to put in my CV!

      Came to this world june 1990. 
      born, raised and still living in sweden (current location Ulrichamn). 
      I live on the country-side with my wife and 3 kids. 
      Dreaming of a small farm in the middle of nowhere where I can become self-sustained.

      Who am I and what are my strenghts/weknesses?
    </p>

    <p>
      I have a strong abbility to adapt to the environment I'm in. 
      If there is no obvious leader in the group I usually take that place in a team but I do not let it go over my head. 
      I prefer that the leader activity is more fluent and shouldn't be a sort of a "role" to play because leader activites are better consumed by multiple individuals.
      The best way to get going as a group is to flatten out the authority and make every voice count. 
    </p>

    <p>
      I value planning my work. Hate writing code like a western shootout. 
      Flowcharts and Pseudo-Code is my middlename. 
      I have learned the way of agile development but I'm a big fan of documentation. 
    </p>

    <p>
      So what about my weaknesses? Everyone has those. 
      The important thing is to be aware of them and to continously work with them. 
      Criticism is one of my top fears. 
      For alot of years I've worked with how to handle it and improve myself on it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Culture is another thing thats important to me.
      I need to find a place where I belong. You can say that I need a second family, a family where we share different kinds of experiences than at home.
      I think that it's important to differentiate freetime and work so there's to be clear bounderies.

    <p>
      What I have discovered is that you never stop learning. The more you learn the more you realise what you don't know.
      Every day I'm learn new things and it's what makes this profession so fun. The hunger for knowledge is endless!

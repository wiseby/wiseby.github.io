Monday starts off with weak coffee. Missed one or two spoons of beans!! Not OK!!! Have to make another pot :expressionless:

### GRBL and Milling Machines

I have always been curious about CNC milling (or talking to a machine with g-codes in general) and I finally got to it and tried out GRBL. I hooked it all up with A4988 drivers and some steppers. 

I found [GRBLWeb](https://github.com/andrewhodel/grblweb) on github to have some kind of UI for testing. A good entry point to see how I could create my own integration in the future. There is also of course [OctoPrint](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint) (my favorite repo on github, use that software every day!) that I could use as a reference.

### AVR Programming without Arduino IDE in pure C

Following along in this book [Make: AVR Programming]()  

(Image of book maybe)

### Serving a purpose at work, saying 'No' to minimize focus areas.

It's time to take a step back, being that new developer who says yes to everything without knowing how to estimate time is not going to en well! 

### Another year, do I have goals to achieve?

I'm building my own keyboard.

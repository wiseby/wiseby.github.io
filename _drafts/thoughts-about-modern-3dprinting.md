## Why you should get into 3D-Printing

Get involved and solve problems. The only tricky part can be to find the correct model to print if your not designing it yourself. That one thing that I think is the greatest trait about this subject is that I can create almost anything within my home. I dont need to order anything online, go to a store to find something that almost fits my needs, but rather create something that solves the problem exactly as I imagined (or close to it). The only thing that I need is a creative mind, a spool of filament and of course some electricity and sometimes a internet connection if I'm lucky to find what I want to print online. This tool fits my needs what it comes to sustainabiity. My long term plan is to get rid of the idea about physical logistics. I want to be able to solve my problems right here, right now with supplies available near my home. Think of all the crap that people buy online without hesitation or even a thought about where the stuff comes from and how it is produced. With this tool, maybe we could 

## To much props and nice looking things!

What are people printing? Farms print crap and people buy it!?

Things out there:
- Toys
- Cosplay stuff
- Helmets?
- Decorative objects for your home
- Upgrades to printers (yeah, this is a subject of it's own!)

Just take a look on the most popular models on any site (thingiverse, printables, thangs, etc). To me it's just nice looking things that produces little to no value in terms of sustainablity. Yes there are also good models out there and I see them every day and I always pay more attention promoting the artists behind those.

What is missing then? Actual spare-parts catalogs. I should be able to search for parts for my products with a simple serial-number and viola, models ready to print and replace.

## What I think 3D-Printing is all about

You should think more about what you print.
The 3D-Printer is a tool you should use to solve problems, imagine anything breaking in your home, instead of ordering new parts or products to either replace or repair it you should be able to print it yourself. I know it's not possible to print everything, but close enough. Many of those things that breaks are often made of plastic, at least the things that is in my home.

### Quality of Life Improvments

For someone like me, I often wonder about how to make things easier in my day to day life, when I struggle with anything really. The idea to make a process easier, safer,  

You should be able to get creative and make things with your printer that you, yes you, can use and find value in.

## The speed obsesity.

Why do you need to print so freaking fast? Printing, like any other manufacturing process, needs time both in a design phase and to figure out wether it is neccessary to even produce something. We need to be more considerative about what we produce and what is worth the energy we consume on this planet. I think that printers speeds are irrelevant and we are in a good place with the technology right now. We have other issues to attend, like getting good models out to the web so people find what they need and see the benefit of this technology. I have no experience with these fast speed demons of printers but I dont see the need for such machines. I'm happy with what I have and when my printers are running, I can do other things.

## The sum of it all

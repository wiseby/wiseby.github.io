Monday onsight picking up USB-hub.

Investigating database relations.

Working as a pair. Good to do some tasks alone.

Working with local data inside angular application was the easiest way to get going!
Figuring out models and API endpoint maps was difficult 

Working with bootstrap is at first easy, but when you have more advanced layouts it gets confusing. Sometimes it's easier to write css on your own.

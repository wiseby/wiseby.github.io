Working with mock data in Express Server.
Loading from json files.
There was already an existing API for certain domains we where using. So we made it easy for ourselves and used that to query data for our application. Used postman to request the data and then copy/pasted it in a json-file for our Express Server to diguest as response to calls on the localhost mock api. This made the data more realistic, this made it simpler for me to understand the data.

Linting is implemented in the project and we had some issues to resolve. A great way making all developers 

My motivation has been a little lower this week.

JSON. Too be camelCase or to be PascalCase? Noo I wanna be snake_case!
We built the entire application using variable names with camelCase syntax and now our api is sending responses with PascalCasing.
Such a simple bug but yet so tedious!

UI extra everything === High Maintenance
As we thought from the beginning, treeview is back on the table!

Network problems makes my days frustrating. Managed to make the connection to DA for a longer period of time this week. 

Been working on my resume lately and want to start the process of jobb-searching early on. At the start of the summer I'm going to have a job! No excuses!

Anyone looking for a System Developer?

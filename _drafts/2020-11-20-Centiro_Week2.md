New week new challanges! I feel great! The sunday depression feeling is no longer of existens in my life.
The turn-around happened when I finally found that place in my life where everything clicked. I'm partially talking about changing my carreer from industrial worker to become a programmer. Never turning back!

Monday was in and out in different meetings. Many questions needed answers before we could go forward with our project. 
The first meeting was a walkthrough of how the anatomy of the WebApi should be built. A fairly new developer at Centiro (had been working as a fullstack developer at a smaller company before) introduced us to mediator-pattern, dapper, vertical-slicing and a number of enterprice specific libraries used by other similar projects. It wasn't that hard understanding all the pieces and the architecture was straight forward at most part.
The second meeting was with the main team for the application. Here we have a application-specialist and a UX designer and together we got into details about the views and features necessary for the administration application. Databases and tables where introduced to build the models used throughout the process of administration of sender-data.

We ended up the day by breaking down bigger work items into smaller tasks in Azure DevOps and tried to create a new sprint to get all stories into place in the sprint. But unfortunatly we had no permissions to add this at the time. This would get fixed later in the week.




This weeks feeling is exitment. Maybe some frustration on the thought were not writing enough code. Alot of time is spent on planning.

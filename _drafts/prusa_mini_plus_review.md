If I was starting with 3D-Printing today, I would most definitly buy myself this machine from start!

A short rundown of the machine is in order. There are many other reviews out there that makes a better job explaining the details but I'm going to tell you about what makes this printer stand out. The friendly user interface. Never has anything been so intuitive. A simple scroll knob with push to confirm is all you need, and of course a emergency stop button. I know that this is the industri standard, but it's worth mentioning. Many other manufacturers of printers are trying to hard and adding touchscreens and what not, thats a little much for me to be honest. 

The build volume is 180x180x180mm and in many cases that's all I need.

The Prusa Mini has it all, and it just works. It might not look much to the world but it has some serious muscles.

As of this writing my Prusa Mini has run for a total of 18 days

The form-factor of this machine makes it possible for every household to fit it somewhere.

It prints well with PLA, PETG and even Flexible material such as TPU.

They release new software/firmware with new features

Prusa Research makes us happy. This community around Prusas printers are fenomenol! They have everything available on their siteas it comes from spare-parts, their own filaments and models database. 

I would recommend purchasing a structured flexible buildplate as an addition to the smooth PEI-sheet so you can print PETG and other exotic filaments without using glue and/or other adhesive substances. With this sheet you can do it all.

Working alone this week when my classmate woke up with fever this morning.

Started to implement Direct Proxy on the client app.
Got runtime error on a part where I haven't been working. It's another part that uses the same techniques I'm implementing.

Made some changes in the api where endpoint urls where a bit funny looking. Noticed how easy it was changing code with the architecture we used.

Getting better and better at breaking tasks apart. It helps me focus and if I notice other things in the code that needs fixing I simply create a new work-item for it to come back for later. 

Working on how to use different collections in the term of relations in objects.
Used LookUp collection and Dictionary

This week I'm in need for a stand in code reviewer when I'm making Pull Requests.
It would be nice having a developer who has experience in angular to add productive feedback for once.
Maybe I've made it the wrong way the whole time!?

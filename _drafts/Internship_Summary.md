Hello everyone!

Let us introduce ourselves. We are two students from [Borås Yrkeshögskolan](https://www.boras.se/utbildningochforskola/borasyrkeshogskola/utbildningar/systemutvecklarenet.4.3fde8c191684442015123edf.html), Lucas Wiseby and Johan Andersson. As a part of our education to become System Developers we do our internship here at Centiro Solutions.

Our journey began 9th of november 2020 and was about to last for 24 weeks. We where placed in the team Nova to rebuild a SelfService known as Sender Administration.

This application had over the years become slow and hard to work with, and our mission was to build it from scratch with modern tools to enhance performance and scalability.

We created a team for our daily routines. In this team we have our mentor Eric Lundmark (System Developer), Nicolas Tremezano-Larsson (Application Specialist) and Tobias Lagström (UI/UX Designer).

Our goal was to have enough features in place before april so we could disable the old C3Win SenderAdmin, by only taking what was absolutely necessary for all users to do there day to day work. This was actually the hardest part, what do we need? We decided to let the users answer that through testing. That's why we released it at an early state with a basic set of features into a hand-picked customer environments. The power of User Acceptance Tests worked there magic and suggestions (more like angry complaints!) and feature requests stormed in!

The process of making this kind of rebuild has been though. There was I general idea of how things should look and feel, but not much more than that. When you say that we should solve a task piece by piece, we literally did that and made proper adjustments along the way, sometimes taking more steps backwards than forward. The "Why" was always the key question when implementing a feature.

, but have you seen how relationships in the database actually relates!?
The biggest time consumer is understanding the data, and this system is a bit old and big.

It has been a test of all sorts. We have been working 100% remote, changing design directions more than once, learned to collaborate with teams and much, much more.

The feeling that we get when working for Centiro is kindness and understanding. Everything we do shows great appreciation

It has been a exiting experience and we have learned so much this past 6 months. We scratched the surface and we are going to dig deeper. Yes you heard us! We are proud to become true Centiroits as we are beginning our employments at Centiro after we graduate!

We hope to learn and flourish with all of you as we fight together for a greater future.

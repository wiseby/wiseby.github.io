## The Great Journey

# From the oily pits of industri to clean office-landscapes and texteditors

My story begins with a collegue who tells me to purchase a micro-controller (In this case the popular Arduino was purchased). 
He told me that this was something that I would love to tinker with.
He explained what possibilities it would unlock and I was amazed!
All my life I have used computers and thought that I never could understand how it worked!
Now I was hooking up LEDs, LCDs, resistors, buttons, servos, sensors and wrote software to make spectacular creations.

Okej, so this wasn't that hard! I bet that I could understand how to make computer programs.
Python was my first language for desktop(cli) programming and this was a much higher level of programming.
I used python to create websites with flask, used pygame to develope my first game and much more.
I did this on my spare time and worked in industrial manufacturing (wich I had done for almost 10 years at this point). Alongside work I took some College courses in Object Oriented Programming to boost my grade so I could get in a bigger program later on.
    
This was the turning point in my carrier. I desided that I wanted to become a software-developer! 
But I needed something more robust in my backpack, something to make the employers raise there eyebrows.
An education! I began to study at Borås Yrkeshögskola were they started a new 2 year program with the title "System Developer .NET".
This was a perfect opportunity and I was already familiar with C#, this would give something to put in my Resume!

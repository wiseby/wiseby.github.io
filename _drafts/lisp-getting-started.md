The Why:
I needed a second programming language in my toolbox. I was curious about Functional Programming and started the search for the perfect candidate. F# would be the more natural choice because it's a .NET language and I am working alot with C# today (and it uses the same CLR so the outcome of both C# and F# would be the same?). A language that often comes up in articles and podcasts I attend to is [Lisp](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp) (LISt Processing). It runs prefferebly on linux, is almost as old as Fortran and created to explore the world of Artifical Intelligence. 

install: 
* sbcl (Steel Banks Common Lisp) common Lisp engine
* SLIME
* Emacs as IDE
* MELPA for emacs lisp library repository.

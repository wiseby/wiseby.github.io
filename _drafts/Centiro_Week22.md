Got the direct communication port to all the people who are using the application. In this channel we could see exactly what everyone had in mind regarding the SenderAdministration application.

A new feature was brought to our attention that everyone screamed about.
A feature that has been a separate app that could easily be integrated nto Sender Administration.

**What Happened?**

I got my refactoring branch up with the new architecture in place. There was still much work to be done, but it should be easier to fix now. The important step now is to take baby-steps and make the code cleaner for every commit.

Got dragged into another project from another Product Team. They needed a frontend for there system. Without my mentors knowledge I was participating a meeting and asked to **estimate time for a finished frontend!!** ðŸ˜° I'm a junior developer and should estimate work like this!?
I discussed this with my mentor and he insisted to go with me and address the issue. My mentor is a person that asks questions about the execution and purpose and he managed to get the answer that it wasn't a priority to get this done this urgent. This was a exiting project to get going with so we made up a plan with a rough estimate.

Me and Johan have a friend that sits in another team and we talk a lot. He often shares information from his team about the company and it makes me so confused some times. One thing is said on one end and from our another. I know how to handle these things and it's to listen to may closest supervisor and if I need clarification, I'll ask this person myself. This time it was about where we will be placed when we start our employment at Centiro. But with the reorganization there are many uncertainties. I got the answer that it would probably not be decided before summer, but there is work to be done I'll tell you so no worries there. Hopefully I get to work in different parts of Centiro so I get a wider understanding of the organization.

**Final Thoughts**

Be the person who asks questions. If you don't understand something, stand up and admit that. I'm most curtain that if you are at a meeting without anyone asking questions there is someone that has a hard time understanding what is discussed. There is a common fear of being the one without knowledge so the easiest thing you could do is to nod and agree with everyone and then step out not knowing what should be done. Communication is key!

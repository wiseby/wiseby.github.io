**The Monday Feeling**

A typical monday. Nothing special about it, let's get coding!

**What Happened?**

Final week as an intern. So much I wanted to finish!

- Creating tests for both the backend and frontend.
- Rework some services in the ClientApp
- Have a Code Review session with a senior programmer.
- Fix more bugs.

We discussed what was left before releasing it in PROD environments and the Nova team would get together and finish off in the following week.

Our mentor asked if we could write a little summary of our time so he could post it at Centiros intranet called "Holonet". This was so people could pay attention to the work we have done and to give us 

I got a call from an indian friend who wanted help with the setup of another SelfService application. Can you believe it, me helping senior developers? I've got this warm feeling afterwards, that I actually managed to explain something. I'm getting more and more confident in myself and this is huge steps for me. Hopefully I'll become a master like my mentor and maybe take on my own apprentice some day.

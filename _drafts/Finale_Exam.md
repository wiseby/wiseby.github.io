Everything we have learned gathered into a single project. It's time to show everyone what I've learned the past 2 years! The project is called **Hackers-HomeAuto** and is a DIY Home Automation system.

The hardware is a mixture of Raspberry Pies, Arduinos and other microcontrollers that utilizes a wider range of sensors for home-automation purposes.

The main purpose is to monitor my home and to build statistics on data collected from sensors. Making it possible to show statistics on data impacting energy consumption.

Decided to use MongoDB for all my data. It's going to be a hole new experience to add in my portfolio!
The Mongo Driver is super mature and amazing to use I've heard!

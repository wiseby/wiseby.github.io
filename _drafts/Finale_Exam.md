Everything we have learned gathered into a single project. It's time to show everyone what I've learned the past 2 years! The project is called **Hackers-HomeAuto** and is a DIY Home Automation system.

The hardware is a mixture of Raspberry Pies, Arduinos and other microcontrollers that utilizes a wider range of sensors for home-automation purposes.

The main purpose is to monitor my home and to build statistics on data collected from sensors. Making it possible to show statistics on data impacting energy consumtion.
